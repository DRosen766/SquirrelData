This is my first c++ project.  My objective is to familiarize myself with the language
I will be implementing a B+ Tree to store the dataset in the .csv file.
All credit for the data goes to https://github.com/rfordatascience.

Instructions for using the SquirrelData.sh file:
	This bash script is used to compile and execute the c++ code

Can search for a squirrel within a given latitude range.

For what it's worth, if I were doing this in a language I was more familiar with (ex. Java), I would do this much differently.
	-The data structure would be generic
	-the two types of nodes
	-etc.
I will try to make some of these improvements as I become more familiar with c++.
Feel free to check out my Data Structures repository for some better looking stuff.
